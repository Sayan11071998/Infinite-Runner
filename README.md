Infinite Runner (Unreal Engine 5)

Inspired by classics like Subway Surfer and Temple Run, I’ve developed a new game called "Infinite Runner" created using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) starter content and Blueprints.

In this game:

🌟 The character runs infinitely on a platform, skillfully avoiding obstacles.

⚠️ Collisions with obstacles result in a restart of the level.

🎯 The score is based on the distance the player character runs.
