# ***🚀 Infinite Runner 🎮***

Welcome to **Infinite Runner**, a fast-paced endless runner inspired by popular games like Subway Surfer and Temple Run! This project has been a great opportunity for me to dive deeper into Unreal Engine 5 and work with Blueprints to create a fun and dynamic experience.

**🎮 Game Features**
**🌟 Infinite Running:** The player character runs endlessly across platforms, dodging various obstacles along the way.
**⚠️ Obstacle Collisions:** Hitting any obstacle results in a level restart, pushing players to perfect their timing and reflexes.
**🎯 Score System:** The longer the player survives, the higher the score! The score is based on the distance traveled, motivating players to keep going.

**🧠 Key Learnings**
- Developed character movement and obstacle avoidance using Unreal Engine 5 Blueprints.
- Implemented a collision system to reset the level upon impact with obstacles, encouraging replayability.
- Created a distance-based scoring system to track and reward players' progress.

**🚀 What's Next?**
This is just the beginning! Future updates to Infinite Runner will include:

- 🏃‍♂️ More complex and dynamic obstacles to keep the gameplay challenging.
- 💰 Collectible coins to add an extra layer of engagement.
- 🎮 New gameplay mechanics to enhance the experience and keep players hooked!
